Before doing anything, run this:
echo -e "\n\033[1;32m══════════════════════════════════\033[0m"
echo -e "\033[1;32m  🚀 PRD: IMPLEMENT\033[0m"
echo -e "\033[1;32m══════════════════════════════════\033[0m\n"

Read PRD.md. If COMPARE.md exists, apply winners from it.

Implement what's agreed in those docs. $ARGUMENTS may have extra instructions.

If something is ambiguous, skip it and note it.

After implementing, list:
- What you did
- What you skipped and why
